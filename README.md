#CS1C Assignment01 Subset-sum 

This assignment is in 2 parts:
##Part 1:
This represents shopping with a finite amount of money.  There is a shopping
list with dollar amounts asssociated with items. The goal is to buy as many
things as possible. So the subsets of the superset (grocery list) are needed to
maximize purchasing.

##Part2:
This represents a store that you are purchasing songs from.  There is a menu
that sorts by genre or selects a title. This time you input a duration to see
how many songs can add up to a duration that is input by the user.
